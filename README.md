February 19, 2026
## Abstract
This proposal outlines the concept and structure of the FinTech Club at the University of
Puerto Rico: Mayag¨uez. The document is structured into distinct sections: the Introduction,
Mission, Vision, Core Focus, Foundation Story, Road Map, and Long-term Impact.
##1 Introduction
”We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.” — Alan
Turing. As the father of modern computing saw the need to look forward, the FinTech Club at the
University of Puerto Rico looks to bridge the gaps in the short distance we can see ahead. Our purpose
is to foster the next generation of future leaders in the Financial Technology sector by building trust
with leaders today.
## 2 Mission
Our Mission is to bring together students, academia, and industry to cultivate learning experiences in
the technological foundations of finance. We encourage hands-on growth in mathematics, engineering,
and computer science, ensuring that each member gains genuine, applicable skills. Together, we bridge
the worlds of theory and application, all walking the same path toward innovation.
## 3 Vision
We envision a pioneering FinTech Club at the University of Puerto Rico: Mayag¨uez that builds
lasting, self sustaining relationships between academia and industry. Through these connections,
today’s learning becomes tomorrows collaborations ensuring future professionals and researchers give
back, sustaining the clubs impact for generations.

## 4 Core Focus
Our core focus is advancing the quantitative and technological pillars of FinTech, exploring deep
domains in applied mathematics, computational finance, engineering systems, and algorithmic innova-
tions that shape the financial landscape. We complement academic coursework by applying concepts
from areas such as machine learning, quantitative modeling, blockchain technology, and algorithmic
design and analysis. Participation does not require prior knowledge in finance or economics. We em-
phasize mastery of the computational, mathematical, and engineering pillars of the Interdisciplinary
area of study that is FinTech.
In our FinTech Club, the core skills we emphasize, such as data analysis, software design, and
mathematical modeling, are directly applicable to FinTech innovations. Data analysis allows for the
development of predictive financial models. The principles of software design underpin the creation
of secure blockchain networks and scalable financial platforms. In addition, mathematical modeling
is vital for conducting risk assessments and optimizing investment portfolios. By focusing on these
interdisciplinary skills, we prepare our members to drive meaningful and innovative advancements in
the FinTech sector.
## 5 Foundation Story
The foundation of our FinTech Club is rooted in the recognition that economic vulnerabilities, such
as financial crises and bankruptcies, highlight the urgent need for robust, data-driven approaches in
the financial sector. Historical financial mismanagement has repeatedly exposed the fragility of infras-
tructure and public trust, emphasizing that without integrating quantitative modeling, technological
innovation, and engineering principles, the financial sector remains vulnerable. As we strive to build
a resilient financial ecosystem, we recognize that trust is the cornerstone of meaningful collaboration
between academia, industry, and students.
In the spirit of this trust, our FinTech Club is dedicated to integrating cutting-edge quantitative
methods and technological innovations. By fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration, we
aim to rebuild and reinforce trust across all stakeholders. This approach ensures that our members
are equipped to drive meaningful and innovative advancements in the FinTech sector, paving the way
for a more resilient and trustworthy financial future.
Our club is committed to bridging this gap by emphasizing the interdisciplinary skills of mathe-
matics, computer science, and engineering. By focusing on these core competencies, we aim to create a
resilient financial ecosystem that can withstand future crises, whether they are economic downturns or
systemic failures. Through this approach, we prepare our members to drive meaningful and innovative
advancements in the FinTech sector, ensuring that we build a foundation for a stronger, more reliable
financial future.
## 6 Road map
Development Phase: In the development phase, our primary focus will be on laying a solid foun-
dation for the club. This includes recruiting initial members, defining roles, and establishing core
partnerships with faculty and industry professionals. By the end of this phase, we will have a cohesive,
well-prepared group ready to tackle more complex initiatives.
Growth Phase: As we move into the growth phase, the club will expand its reach and deepen its
impact. This phase will focus on hosting larger events, such as hackathons, seminars, and collabora-
tive projects with industry partners. We will also work on strengthening mentorship programs and
providing more hands-on experiences that allow members to apply their skills in real-world scenarios.
This phase aims to build a robust network, increase the club’s visibility, and foster meaningful collab-
orations that propel members forward.
Sustainability Phase: In the sustainability phase, the club will focus on long-term impact and
resilience. This includes nurturing a pipeline of future leaders, continuously adapting to industry
advancements, and creating initiatives that contribute to the broader community. We will focus on
ensuring the club’s legacy by fostering ongoing partnerships, supporting local economic development,
and consistently adapting our strategies to meet emerging needs.
## 7 Long-Term Impact
The long-term impact of our FinTech Club extends far beyond the immediate growth and development
of its members. By consistently engaging students and fostering a collaborative environment, the club
will ignite a genuine interest in FinTech and related fields among the university’s student body. This
growing interest will naturally lead to the emergence of innovative research projects that tackle real-
world challenges, enriching the academic landscape and encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration.
As these research initiatives gain momentum, they will pave the way for the development of spe-
cialized courses and programs at the university. Over time, the club’s influence will extend beyond the
campus, fostering partnerships with industry leaders and other institutions, and contributing to the
broader economic resilience of Puerto Rico.
In this way, the FinTech Club will not only cultivate a new generation of scholars and innovators
but will also leave a lasting legacy, ensuring that the university and the island remain at the forefront
of financial technology and innovation.
